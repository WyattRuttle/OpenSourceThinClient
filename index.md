## Welcome to OpenSourceThinClient

OpenSourceThinClient is a boot image which allows low-end PCs to be used as a thin-client to login to remote computers. The project is a modified version of Xubuntu Core that starts up into a simple menu for RDP and SSH services. The OS is as lightweight as possible so that it can be run on low requirements using a USB with persistent storage.
